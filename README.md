# iubat-course-completed
 This is a React web application that displays a table of course information (course code, course name, and credits) using data from a JSON file. The app features an interactive table that allows the user to select one or multiple rows, and displays the total credits of the selected rows in a separate paragraph. The table has hover effects on each item, and uses CSS to achieve border collapse. This project is a good example of using React to display data in an interactive and visually appealing way.
